# Tiny Search Engine
Tiny Search Engine (TSE) is a command-line search program written in C that will take a valid seed URL and allows the user to search for specific words on that URL and all of its subpages. It then returns a list of pages ranked with respect to the frequency of occurrences that contain the relevant word (or words).

Keywords like 'and', 'or' and 'not' are also functional when searching for specific word patterns. This program is capable of crawling webpages to access subpages, parsing web content, and responding to userâ€™s UI queries.
